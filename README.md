## A little about me

**I'm a frontend developer, I'm currently in **Full Stack Web** training at <a href="https://www.labenu.com.br">_Labenu_</a>, having experience in practical individual and group projects, 
using technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and others. I have a postgraduate degree in Cinema, Radio and TV, I have been a photographer 
and video editor for 7 years, with professional experience. I've always liked design, using Photoshop, Figma or Canva. And studying UI/UX I came across Frontend 
and I was sure that from then on I wanted to become a Dev. I am a frontend developer, I am currently in Full Stack Web training, at Labenu, having experience in
